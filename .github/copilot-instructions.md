Write clean, readable code with clear comments in English when necessary to explain complex logic.

Use consistent indentation with 2 spaces for all files including JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and configuration files.

Prefer async/await syntax over promises for asynchronous operations to improve readability.

Add comprehensive tests using Vitest or Jest for all components, hooks, and utility functions to ensure code reliability.

Follow the existing feature-based architecture with separate directories for components, hooks, services, interfaces, and contexts.

Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose.

Implement proper error handling and loading states for user interactions and API calls.

Optimize performance using React best practices like memo, useMemo, and useCallback when appropriate.
